      ##
      # REoptScenarioCSV is an extension of ScenarioCSV which assigns a Simulation Mapper to each Feature in a FeatureFile using a simple CSV format.
      # The a \REopt Lite enabled CSV file has four columns 1) feature_id, 2) feature_name, 3) mapper_class_name and 4) optional reopt assumptions file name.  There is one row for each Feature.
      # A REoptScenarioCSV can be instantiated with set of assumptions to use in \REopt Lite for an optimization at the aggregated ScenarioReport level.
      # A REoptScenarioCSV is also instantiated with a +reopt_files_dir+ file directory containing all \REopt Lite assumptions files (required only if the ScenarioReport or its FeatureReports will have specified assumptions).
      #
      # [*parameters:*]
      #
      # * +name+ - _String_ - Human readable scenario name.   
      # * +root_dir+ - _String_ - Root directory for the scenario, contains Gemfile describing dependencies.     
      # * +run_dir+ - _String_ - Directory for simulation of this scenario, deleting run directory clears the scenario.   
      # * +feature_file+ - _URBANopt::Core::FeatureFile_ - FeatureFile containing features to simulate.   
      # * +mapper_files_dir+ - _String_ - Directory containing all mapper class files containing MapperBase definitions.   
      # * +csv_file+ - _String_ - Path to CSV file assigning a MapperBase class to each feature in feature_file.  
      # * +num_header_rows+ - _String_ - Number of header rows to skip in CSV file.  
      # * +reopt_files_dir+ - _String_ - Path to folder containing default \REopt Lite assumptions JSON's.  
      # * +scenario_reopt_assumptions_file_name+ - _String_ - Name of .json file in the +reopt_files_dir+ location to use in assessing the aggregated ScenarioReport in \REopt Lite.
